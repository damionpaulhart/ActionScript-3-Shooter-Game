Object-oriented ActionScript 3.0 Shooter Game for Flash

I started this project in 2010, even though Flash was out of favor with most people, HTML5 has not quite gotten out of the gate.

The project is completely obeject-oriented with several design patterns used such as factories and singletons; Classes have custom EvenHandlers for events like collison.

I do not think I will update this code, but it can easily be ported to other languages.
